# sbt-reactive-app

This project implements an SBT plugin that uses [SBT Native Packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager) and
reflection to build Docker images. These images contain metadata that is used with a CLI tool to create resources
for Kubernetes and potentially other target platforms.
